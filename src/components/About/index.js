					In my free time, I love playing sports as well as watching them. My
					favorite sport is soccer and I support a Brazilian team called Gremio.
					Furthermore, I really enjoy watching Netflix and YouTube. Reading is
					one of my favorite passtimes, mostly nonfictional books, although I do
					like some fiction occasionally. My favorite book is "The Rise and Fall
					of Nations" by Ruchir Sharma.
